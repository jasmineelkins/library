This Book Library app was designed & built by Jasmine Elkins and Kristen Cadacio for our Phase 4 project at Flatiron School.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
- Have at least three models on the backend, that include:
  - at least one one-to-many relationship
  - at least one many-to-many relationship
  - full CRUD actions for at least one resource
- Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user should be able to log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash.

TO-DO LIST:

- left/right buttons to scroll collections _KRIS WEDNESDAY_
- clicking a book opens modal with more info _KRIS WEDNESDAY_
- icon changes depending on shelf: plus(add to list), bookmark(want to), heart(read), book(currently) _JAS THURSDAY_
- user can remove a book from their shelf _JAS THURSDAY_
