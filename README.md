This Book Library app was designed & built by Jasmine Elkins and Kristen Cadacio for our Phase 4 project at Flatiron School.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
- Have at least three models on the backend, that include:
  - at least one one-to-many relationship
  - at least one many-to-many relationship
  - full CRUD actions for at least one resource
- Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user should be able to log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash.

TO-DO LIST:

- WHY IS PASSWORD SHOWING UP BLANK??????
- back end CRUD methods (done for users & books, need for shelves)
- front end components: separate components for Netflix-style collections (ReadingCollection, WantToReadCollection, FavoritesCollection....) (KRIS RESEARCH STYLING)
- set up Navbar (home, my books, user account)
- add searched book to collection
- render books on page
- React Router?
- authorization, add users, don't show password (serializer)
- only login OR signup is showing (JAS MONDAY)
- home page: signup/login. clicking signup pops up form, possibly MUI?
- show book lists using Netflix style, horizontal slideshow. clicking on a book brings a pop up.
